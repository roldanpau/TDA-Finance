What is TDA-Finance?

TDA-Finance is a Topological Data Analyzer of financial time series. 
It receives a time series (e.g. the price evolution of an asset) and 
computes the persistence diagram, persistence landscape, and L1 norm 
of the landscape.

It allows for 1-dimensional and n-dimensional time series. 
The user can control the most important parameters of the process, 
but TDA-Finance tries to compute reasonable default values for the 
parameters, optimized for the input time series.

TDA-Finance has been developed and tested using in the R environment, 
so it runs in any version of Windows, Linux, and Mac.

TDA-Finance is released under the GNU Public License (GPL), so 
anybody with Internet access is free to get it and to redistribute it.
